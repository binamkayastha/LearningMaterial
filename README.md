# LearningMaterial

This repo is not so much a program but rather files which I use for reference for languages, mostly syntax and operations etc. I'm also in the process of moving some repo's into this one due to the fact that they were small and discontinued, and mostly used for learning purposes anyways.

Currently has:

- Android
    - Simple Counter Application
- LaTeX
    - CColor.tex:   Color scheme for the C language
    - WPITalk.tex   Notes on a talk about latex from the Math Department at WPI
    - graphs.tex:   Litterally how to box a piece of multi-line text
    - template.tex: My base template I use for my article documents
- Talks
    - symbolicvariables: Notes on a talk about using symbolic variables in Matlab at WPI
    - TensorFlow:   Notes on a TenserFlow given at the Massachusetts Spotify office
- Vim
    - Autocommands.txt: Notes on autocommands in vim and how to make them.
- Python
    - Generic Python Stuff
    - Flask
